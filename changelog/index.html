    <ul>
      <li>
        Upgrades have been implemented to ensure compatibility with the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 release.
        <br />Additionally, these enhancements are expected to function with insider versions of Windows; however,
        please note that insider builds are not officially supported.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="64bit">64-bit Architecture</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lively is transitioning from x86 (32-bit) to x64 (64-bit) process architecture.</li>
      <li>
        This change will enhance application performance by better utilizing system resources.<br />
        If your current installation has admin privileges, you may receive a one-time prompt asking for the install
        type. This is normal.<br />
        A restart may be requested at the end of the installation process. While not strictly required, it is
        recommended.<br />
        For backward compatibility, the installer filename remains listed as x86.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="commandline">Commandline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New <b>random</b> setwp option which sets a random wallpaper from library.</li>

      >
      <li>Setting wallpaper not present in library will now get auto imported if its media file.</li>
      <li>Sending commands directly through application executable is now instant, 1s delay is gone.</li>
    </ul>

        When a unique DeviceId is not available for display, a hashcode is generated which should resolve some

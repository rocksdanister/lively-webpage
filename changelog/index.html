        <p class="subheader">17 Sept 2025 | Lively v2.2.0.0 - 2.2.1.0 Update</p>
        <h1>Big Update</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="media-border">
      <img class="hero" src="assets/latest/hero_art.webp" />
    </div>
    <p>
      This is the biggest update in a long time and comes with better wallpaper pausing, better localization, better
      screensavers and over 20+ fixes and improvements - including full compatibility with
      <strong>Windows 11 24H2</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>This follow-up update v2.2.1.0 builds on the previous release, bringing improvements and some bug fixes.</p>

    <h3 id="grid-pause">Grid Pause Algorithm</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-grid-pause" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/grid_pause.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Replaced the default foreground window based pause detection with a grid based screen coverage algorithm - the
        screen is now divided into a grid (tiles), and intersection calculation is used to check if windows are visually
        covering the display.
      </li>
      <p>Solves several edge cases where the previous logic failed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple windows (example: side by side), now correctly trigger pause.</li>
        <li>Works even if a background window, not the foreground one, is covering the wallpaper.</li>
        <li>Each display can now pause independently in per-display mode.</li>
        <li>Reliable desktop detection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To see the detection in real time, right-click the Lively tray icon and choose Report Bug → Grid Detection
        Overlay.
      </p>
      <li>Now when duplicate layout is selected all wallpapers are paused.</li>
      <li>New All Process algorithm available in settings - scans all windows and check for fullscreen.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Note: Some performance related settings will be reset to default after this update.</p>

    <h3 id="language">Animated WebP Support</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-webp" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/webp_support.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for animated WebP format.</li>
      <li>WebP files are converted to WebM during import.</li>
      <li>Wallpaper customisation is supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is an initial experiment, planning on adding conversion support for more formats in the future.</p>

    <h3 id="language">Language Enhancements</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-localization" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/localization.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Added custom language selection - preferred language can be selected from settings.</li>
      <li>[Experimental] Language change applies instantly without requiring an app restart.</li>
      <li>
        Added localization support for:
        <ul>
          <li>LivelyProperties (wallpaper customization.)</li>
          <li>LivelyInfo (wallpaper metadata.)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 id="wallpaper-creation">Wallpaper Enhancements</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-wallpaper-creation" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/wallpaper_creation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Changed wallpaper import system: now copies wallpaper file(s) to the wallpaper library location instead of just
        referencing the original path.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Previously imported wallpapers remain unaffected - to migrate them to library location, use the Edit option
            in library.
          </li>
          <li>
            For wallpaper projects with multiple files, a confirmation dialog now shows the expected folder structure
            before importing.
          </li>
          <li>
            From this version onward, newly imported wallpapers no longer depend on the original file - you can safely
            delete it without causing file not found errors.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Faster bulk imports: multiple media wallpapers are now imported faster by utilizing system thumbnail cache.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="webview2">WebView2 (Default)</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-webview2" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/webview2_install.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>WebView2 is now the default browser engine for website wallpapers.</li>
      <li>
        Since WebView2 comes pre-installed with Windows, the app no longer needs to bundle a browser engine, reducing
        the install size by ~50%.
      </li>
      <li>Now website wallpapers support H.264 media playback out of the box.</li>
      <li>New debug DevTools, opens in a separate window.</li>
      <li>
        Improved handling of media elements - when a wallpaper is paused, any playing video or audio elements on the
        page are also paused automatically.
      </li>
      <li>Previous CefSharp player is provided as additional download on release page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Some browser related settings will be reset to default after this update.</p>

    <h3 id="screensaver">Screensaver Enhancements</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-screensaver-enhancements" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/screensaver_fadein.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Fade-in animation when screensaver starts, any user input during this phase cancels activation.</li>
      <li>
        Introduced a grace period: if input is received shortly after screensaver starts, system lock is skipped (when
        "lock on resume" is enabled).
      </li>
      <li>Screensaver settings have been reorganized and are now part of the main settings page for easier access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="audio-output">Audio by Display</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-audio-output" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/display_audio.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now choose which display's wallpaper is allowed to play audio.</li>
      <li>In Per-screen layout, only the wallpaper on the selected display will output sound.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This feature is only available when using the "Grid" or "All process" pause algorithm.</p>

    <h3 id="visualizer-input">Visualizer Audio Source</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-visualizer-input" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/audio_input.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now choose which audio device the wallpaper visualizer uses.</li>
      <li>
        The Default option follows the system's default playback device and updates automatically if the system default
        changes.
      </li>
      <li>If you pick a specific device, it will stay fixed and only switch if that device is disconnected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="beta-switcher">Join the Beta Channel</h3>
    <div class="media-border">
      <video id="promo-beta-switcher" class="video" loop muted>
        <source src="assets/latest/beta_switcher.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
    <p>
      Lively has grown so much over the years that it's no longer possible for me to personally test every feature or
      account for every way people use it. Joining the beta and reporting any issues early is a great way to help.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now switch to Beta or Testing release directly from within the application.</li>
      <li>
        Test releases are updated more frequently and may contain bugs - join only if you're comfortable with potential
        issues.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Similarly you can switch back to the stable release, but because settings or configuration may change between
      versions, you might occasionally need to delete the settings file to fully revert.
    </p>
    <p>When you encounter a problem, report it in the GitHub issues and mention that you're using the beta build.</p>
    <p>Note: This feature is not available for Microsoft Store version.</p>

    <h3 id="video-enhancements">Video Enhancements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Upgraded to MPV player's new <code>gpu-next</code> video backend.</li>
      <li>Better performance and improved video quality.</li>
      <li>Enhances color accuracy and HDR passthrough support in settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="win11">Windows 11 24H2 Compatibility</h3>
    <p>Core components were fully rewritten to adapt to platform changes introduced in Windows 11 24H2.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a critical issue where wallpapers could enter a restart loop on this version of Windows.</li>
      <li>No more wallpaper restarts during some system changes - a limitation of older versions has been removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Special thanks to Microsoft engineers and community members who reached out and helped.</p>

    <h3 id="developer-message">From the Developer</h3>

      It's been a while since the last Lively update - I took a health break and have been gradually easing back into

              Version 2, June 1991

              Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
              51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
              Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
              of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

              Preamble

              The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
              freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
              License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
              software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
              General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
              Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
              using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
              the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
              your programs, too.

              When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
              price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
              have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
              this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
              if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
              in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

              To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
              anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
              These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
              distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

              For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
              gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
              you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
              source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
              rights.

              We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
              (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
              distribute and/or modify the software.

              Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
              that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
              software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
              want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
              that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
              authors' reputations.

              Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
              patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
              program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
              program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
              patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

              The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
              modification follow.

              GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
              TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

              0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
              a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
              under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
              refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
              means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
              that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
              either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
              language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
              the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

              Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
              covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
              running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
              is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
              Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
              Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

              1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
              source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
              conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
              copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
              notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
              and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
              along with the Program.

              You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
              you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

              2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
              of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
              distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
              above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

              a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

              b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
              whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
              part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
              parties under the terms of this License.

              c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
              when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
              interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
              announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
              notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
              a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
              these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
              License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
              does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
              the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

              These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
              identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
              and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
              themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
              sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
              distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
              on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
              this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
              entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

              Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
              your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
              exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
              collective works based on the Program.

              In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
              with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
              a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
              the scope of this License.

              3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
              under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
              Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

              a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
              source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
              1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

              b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
              years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
              cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
              machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
              distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
              customarily used for software interchange; or,

              c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
              to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
              allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
              received the program in object code or executable form with such
              an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

              The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
              making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
              code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
              associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
              control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
              special exception, the source code distributed need not include
              anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
              form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
              operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
              itself accompanies the executable.

              If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
              access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
              access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
              distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
              compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

              4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
              except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
              otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
              void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
              However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
              this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
              parties remain in full compliance.

              5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
              signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
              distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
              prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
              modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
              Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
              all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
              the Program or works based on it.

              6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
              Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
              original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
              these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
              restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
              You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
              this License.

              7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
              infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
              conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
              otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
              excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
              distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
              License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
              may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
              license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
              all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
              the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
              refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

              If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
              any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
              apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
              circumstances.

              It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
              patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
              such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
              integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
              implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
              generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
              through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
              system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
              to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
              impose that choice.

              This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
              be a consequence of the rest of this License.

              8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
              certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
              original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
              may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
              those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
              countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
              the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

              9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
              of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
              be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
              address new problems or concerns.

              Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
              specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
              later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
              either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
              Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
              this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
              Foundation.

              10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
              programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
              to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
              Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
              make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
              of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
              of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

              NO WARRANTY

              11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
              FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
              OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
              PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
              OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
              MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
              TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
              PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
              REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

              12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
              WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
              REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
              INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
              OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
              TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
              YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
              PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
              POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

              If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
              possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
              free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

              To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
              to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
              convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
              the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

              &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
              Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

              This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
              it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
              the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
              (at your option) any later version.

              This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
              but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
              MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
              GNU General Public License for more details.

              You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
              with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
              51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

              Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

              If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
              when it starts in an interactive mode:

              Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
              Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
              This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
              under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

              The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
              parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
              be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
              mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

              You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
              school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
              necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

              Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
              `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

              &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989

              This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
              proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
              consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
              library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
              Public License instead of this License.

              TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

              1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

              2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

              3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

              4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

              5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

              6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

              7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

              8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

              9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
